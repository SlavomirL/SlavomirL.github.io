          Instructions
        </h3>
        <p>
          Dissolve salt in water. Then slowly add flour and mix gradually. Add only enough flour to make a relatively watery mixture (10% of the total volume of flour). Then add yeast and mix again by hand until it is incorporated into the rest of the mixture. Gradually add the remaining flour and continue to mix. Then transfer it to a work surface and knead for 15-20 minutes, as if you were kneading dough, but also tearing it. When you're done, you'll have a ball of dough. Place it under a cloth or in a bowl for 2 hours. Divide the dough into 250-gram balls (use a scale). Shape these into balls using the pinch and tuck method. That is, hold the dough between your thumb and index finger on both sides, as if you pinched it (creating something like a diamond), and then join the pinched ends under the dough. Rotate it 90 degrees and repeat. This is how you shape the ball. Place the balls on a flat surface, cover them, and let them rest for 24 hours. Then carefully remove the ball. Ideally, it was stored on a completely flat surface. Use a spatula or something to lift the dough without bursting the bubbles or damaging the dough too much. It's good to sprinkle the edges with flour to make it easier to lift. Place the dough in a plate with flour, and shape it into a basic shape, slightly pressing in the center so that the dough narrows in the middle (reaching the edges) and is slightly thicker on the edges. Then transfer it to a work surface that you've lightly dusted with flour, and shape it further. Don't touch the edges; leave about 2.5 cm untouched on each side. Join your hands to form a semicircle with your fingers, and then press the dough from the bottom up. When you reach the top, turn it 90 degrees and repeat. This is how you shape it into a circle. Place it on a pizza stone. Add sauce and evenly grated parmesan all over the pizza and a little more where the first slice of each piece will be. If you like, add dried oregano too. Spread olive oil all over the edge of the dough. Place it for 2-3 minutes in a preheated oven with 500-degree Celsius or for 5 minutes if your maximum oven temperature is 250-degree Celsius. In the middle of this time, add mozzarella (first dry it with towels) and basil (you can also add mozzarella at the beginning and basil at the end, depending on your preference). After removing it from the oven, drizzle it with olive oil.
