          Instructions
        </h3>
        <p>
          Prepare the ingredients so that you can keep up when frying. Cut the bread in half, spread a little butter on all halves and prepare on a plate. On another plate, prepare 4 slices of bacon, 4 pieces of burger-shaped meat which you made from minced meat, 4 slices of tomato, 4-8 slices of onion, and 4 lettuce leaves. Cut the blue cheese into 8 strips about 6mm wide.

Once you have everything prepared, heat up an oil on two pans. In one, you'll cook the meat and bacon, and everything else in the other one. Once both are heated, put all the meat on the meat pan and cook for 3.5 minutes, while seasoning the meat with salt and pepper. On the other pan, put the bread for about 20-25 seconds. Once you remove the bread, add the lettuce, then the tomato and onion on top of it. On the meat pan, add the bacon, being careful not to let it burn. After 3.5 minutes, flip the meat over and season with salt and pepper again, then immediately add two slices of blue cheese on each piece. On the bottom halves of the bread, spread mayonnaise and ketchup. Add a lettuce leaf, then the meat, tomato, onion, and finally the bacon. To prevent the burger from falling apart, you can skewer it with a toothpick.
